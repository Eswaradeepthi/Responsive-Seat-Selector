Problem Statement--
Manual Seat Allocation Challenges in Event Management

People who organize events often run into big problems when they have to assign seats by hand for theaters, conferences, and other gatherings. These issues include trouble managing seat bookings , not being able to update seat availability right away, and struggling to offer a booking system that's easy to use on different devices. This often makes users upset less likely to engage, and can lead to mistakes in giving out seats.

Solution--
Seat Selector UI That Works on All Devices
Creating a seat selector UI that adapts to different devices tackles these issues by offering a user-friendly and hands-on interface that makes it easy for people to pick and book seats. This solution keeps seat availability up-to-date in real time, works well on various screen sizes to give users a smooth experience, and makes seat management less of a headache for event planners. It gets users more involved, makes the process more accessible, and cuts down on the hassles that come with assigning seats by hand.
